This is a Tic Tac Toe project created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players select 
their names, click the start button, and play their turns. Each player's turn is indicated 
by blue and red colors, respectively. 

This project demonstrates various front-end skills such as:

- Using factory functions and modular patterns to achieve more organized code 
in JavaScript;
- DOM manipulation;
- Using a dialog modal when the game ends;
- Flexbox and Grid;
- Use of HTML data attribute to create associations between DOM elements and JavaScript;
